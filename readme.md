# 8 Hour Game Dev
Actually, just shy of 6 hours, but that's cool.

It's not much of a game, certainly not complete, but it was a *blast* to make. I made everything myself, the art, code, and even the sound effects I made with a mic.

The entire build was live streamed on Twitch, the collection is here [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/collections/yzkKGAmYwhQSjA). Total time Streaming was 5:54:59, but in reality about 30 minutes of the stream was dead when I got up to deal with my kids and so on.

A windows build of the project is [downloadable here](http://nowarpzone.com/builds/8HD.zip). No WebGL build available as for some reason it was stripping the vertex colors from the Probuilder meshes and I didn't have time to hunt for the bug in Probuilder/Unity that was causing it.

I made the visuals with probuilder, coded in vscode, and sound effects I made with a mic.

You can use the art/sound effets/code here however you want. Grab the project and learn from it. There are myriad ways it can be improved - object pooling being the first thing you should do if you base something off this. Other wise, for under 6 hours of dev, I'm pretty pleased with this.
